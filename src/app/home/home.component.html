      <h2>Hi, I'm Mayank Khanna :)</h2>
      <p>
        I'm current studying Computer Science and Engineering from Chitkara
        University, Rajpura. My main field of interest is Web Development and I
        can make awesome looking webpages that are really cool very easily ! In
        the world of Development where frameworks and tools evolve from
        day-to-day, it really doesn't matter what framework I use. What really
        matters is the willingness and grasping power to learn with the flow.
        And believe you me I'm a really fast learner. I try to go one step at a
        time which makes the whole concept of learning a total easy job and deep
        knowledge of the concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm working with JavaScript, Angular, Java, Node.js and
        Firebase. Some of the other important things that I'll include are
        C/C++, Git, Linux etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also work with Google's Flutter for Android and IOS Development and am
        looking forward to upgrade my skills for Machine Learning and Artificial
        Intelligence.

    The progressbars are just an indecation of my exprience and not my
    knowledge. And Oh! I'm really good when given a task, and these progress
    bars cross <strong>100%</strong> in that case.
